#### Rollic AI GamePlay Agent Case Study Project

This is a prototype version of Bus Jam developed with Unity 6, it's meant to be simple code compared to real game projects. Please check out Bus Jam on the App Store or Google Play for the full game experience before starting this project to have an idea about the game.

### Game Description

Game is a simple game where player tap on passengers on the grid to move them to the same colored bus. If there is no same colored passenger available, 5 slot waiting area can be used. Level is completed when all passengers are moved to the buses. Game is lost if there is no empty slot in the waiting area. 


### Project Goal

You are expected to implement a AI agent using Open AI API to play the game. The agent should be able to play the game without any human intervention. You need to figure out how to use Open AI API inside the project and implement the agent. Also, you need to write prompts to make the model to play the game.

### Project Requirements

- You need to implement the AI agent using Open AI API. Open AI Key 
- It is expected that agent should be able to play the game without any human intervention.
- There are 6 levels inside project, agent should be able to complete at least 5 of them. 

### Extra Points

- You can implement logging mechanism to log the moves of the agent and game state to analyze the agent's performance. It is not mandatory but it will be a plus. You can use csv files or SQLite for logging.


If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. You have 1 week of time after you've got the project.

Good Luck!
